      <description>I was recently asked, &amp;ldquo;What happens when you type a URL into your browser?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a question that always makes me pause, trying to gauge the right level of detail. This time, I clearly missed the mark. In hindsight, I should have asked some clarifying questions to better understand the depth of knowledge the person was seeking. It&amp;rsquo;s a lesson I know well, but sometimes, in the heat of the moment, even the simplest things can trip us up.</description>

      <description>My Minikube journey began with a spark of curiosity ignited by the book kubernetes Up &amp;amp; Running. Minikube was popping up everywhereâ€”articles, tech talks, the whole shebangâ€”but I was still a newbie.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d just built my own little lab with a trusty old Dell Poweredge R710, and I was itching to dive headfirst into the Kubernetes world and see what all the buzz was about! Fast forward to today, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say I&amp;rsquo;m contributing to both the Kubernetes and Minikube projects.</description>
