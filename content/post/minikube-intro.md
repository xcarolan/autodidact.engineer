My Minikube journey began with a spark of curiosity ignited by the book [kubernetes Up & Running](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/kubernetes-up-and-running-2). Minikube was popping up everywhere—articles, tech talks, the whole shebang—but I was still a newbie.

I'd just built my own little lab with a trusty old Dell Poweredge R710, and I was itching to dive headfirst into the Kubernetes world and see what all the buzz was about! Fast forward to today, and I'm proud to say I'm contributing to both the Kubernetes and Minikube projects. I've teamed up with some seriously brilliant people and learned a mountain of knowledge.

Now, I'm super excited to kick off a series of articles all about my Minikube adventures. We're going to get down to the nitty-gritty of how it works. My goal? To help myself and others learn how to contribute in a way that truly makes a difference.

So buckle up and get ready to explore Minikube with me!
